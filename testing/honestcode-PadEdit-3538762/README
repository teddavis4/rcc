#Release notes:

##1.3

Security and general code quality improvements with amazing help from John Forte, Craig Smith, and Brett Terpstra.

Improvements to automatic quote, bracket, parentheses, and brace completion.
For security reasons, the minimum PHP version requirement was raised to 5.0.

On 2011 June 28, this version was moved into to GitHub.

##1.2

File pane is now fully collapsible. Just drag the resize handle all the way to the left. (Thanks, James!)

Fixed a bug where the PadEdit folder was sometimes visible in the file list.

Fixed some error messages w/r/t permissions.

Fixed a bug where a new folder or new file would be put in the wrong folder.

##1.1

Increases minimum permissions requirements to octal 755 (instead of 644).

##1.0

Initial release.


#Known issues:

Coda clips importing is still a little funky.
File permissions are more ... permissive ... than we'd prefer.

Text highlighting in Webkit-based desktop browsers is weird. Like this.

#To do:

Gesture-based shortcuts.

Snipplr.com integration.

Syntax coloring.

WYSIWYG editing.

Firefox support (probably doable around the time it supports SVG files as background images).

Opt-in (instead of opt-out, via %protect%) file editing.
